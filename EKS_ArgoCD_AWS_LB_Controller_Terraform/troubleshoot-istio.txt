in main.tf i have added below

The ‘node_security_group_additional_rules’ block is added to create Security Group ingress rules for the nodegroup.
These rules are specifically for ports 15017 and 15012, allowing traffic from the EKS cluster.
Its important to note that ‘source_cluster_security_group’ is set to true.

Without the ingress rules for ports 15017 and 15012, the installation of Istio in the EKS cluster may result in multiple errors. Some of these errors are shown below.
